# Aircraft System

This repository documents my self-learning journey where I study
basic aircraft flight principles and systems, and apply the concepts
using beginner-level Python programming.

# What I am learning
- Forces of flight (lift, drag, thrust, weight)
- Basic aircraft systems and how an airplane works
- 
# Purpose of this project
- To understand how aircraft fly from an engineering perspective
- To apply programming skills to real-world engineering concepts
- To document my learning process clearly and honestly
