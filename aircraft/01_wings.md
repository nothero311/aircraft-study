# What is a Wing?
A wing is the primary lifting surface of an aircraft.  
Its main function is to generate lift, which allows the aircraft to overcome gravity and remain airborne.

Without wings, controlled and sustained flight is not possible.

# Why Wings are Needed
Wings are designed to convert forward motion into upward force by interacting with the surrounding airflow.

As the aircraft moves forward, air flows over and under the wing.  
This creates a pressure difference, resulting in an upward force known as lift.

For steady flight, the lift produced by the wings must be equal to or greater than the aircraft’s weight.

# Internal Structure of a Wing
A wing is not hollow. It is a carefully engineered structure made to be strong yet lightweight.

Main internal components include:
- **Spars** – primary load-carrying members that resist bending
- **Ribs** – provide aerodynamic shape and structural support
- **Skin** – smooth outer surface that also carries part of the load

Together, these components form a semi-monocoque structure.

# Control Surfaces on Wings

# Ailerons
Ailerons are located near the outer trailing edge of the wings.  
They control the roll movement of the aircraft, allowing it to turn left or right.

When one aileron moves up, the other moves down, creating a rolling motion.

#FLAPS
Flaps are located on the inner trailing edge of the wing.  
They are used during takeoff and landing to increase lift at low speeds.

By extending flaps, the wing produces more lift without increasing aircraft speed.

# Slats (Leading Edge Devices)
Slats are located on the leading edge of the wing.  
They delay stall by allowing the wing to maintain lift at higher angles of attack.

Slats are especially important during low-speed flight.

# Spoilers
Spoilers are panels on the upper surface of the wing.  
They reduce lift and increase drag.

Spoilers are used to:
- assist in descent
- slow the aircraft
- dump lift after landing

# Additional Wing Features

# Winglets
Winglets are small vertical or angled extensions at the wingtip.  
They reduce wingtip vortices and induced drag, improving fuel efficiency.

# Safety and Design Considerations
Aircraft wings are designed with large safety margins.  
They are tested to withstand loads far greater than those experienced in normal flight.

Wings are also designed to flex under load, which helps absorb stress and prevents structural failure.

> Aircraft wings are intentionally flexible rather than rigid.  
> This flexibility increases durability and structural safety.
