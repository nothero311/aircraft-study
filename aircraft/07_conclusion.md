Conclusion

This project documents the major systems of a modern commercial aircraft, focusing on both
engineering principles and pilot-level understanding.

By studying each system individually—wings, fuselage, empennage, engines, landing gear, and cockpit—
it becomes clear that an aircraft is not a single machine, but a coordinated system of structures,
mechanisms, electronics, and human decision-making.

Each component serves a specific purpose:
- Wings generate lift and control roll
- The fuselage provides structural strength and pressurization
- The empennage ensures stability and control
- Engines provide efficient and reliable thrust
- Landing gear enables safe ground operations
- The cockpit integrates human control with automated systems

This structured approach helped deepen my understanding of how aircraft are designed,
why specific engineering choices are made, and how pilots interact with these systems in real flight.

Overall, this project reflects a learning journey that goes beyond textbooks,
combining theory, diagrams, and real-world aircraft examples to build a solid foundation
in aircraft systems and aviation engineering.
