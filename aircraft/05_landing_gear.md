# Landing Gear

![Aircraft landing gear structure](../images/landing_gear.jpg)

# What Is Shown in the Diagram?
The diagram above shows a **modern aircraft main landing gear assembly** with its major structural, mechanical, and hydraulic components labeled.

This type of landing gear is designed to:
- support the aircraft on the ground
- absorb landing impact forces
- allow safe braking and taxiing
- retract into the aircraft after takeoff

# Major Components and Their Functions

# Trunnion
The **trunnion** is the main pivot point where the landing gear attaches to the aircraft structure.

Its function is to:
- support the landing gear
- allow the gear to rotate during extension and retraction

# Retraction Actuators
Retraction actuators are hydraulic devices used to:
- pull the landing gear into the aircraft after takeoff
- extend the landing gear before landing

They provide controlled movement of the gear.

# Rotation Actuators
Rotation actuators control the **rotational motion** of the landing gear during retraction.

This allows the wheels to align correctly inside the wheel well.

# Downlock and Drag Brace
The **downlock and drag brace** system:
- locks the landing gear in the extended position
- prevents collapse during landing or taxiing

This is a critical safety component.

# Forward and Aft Trunnion Braces
These braces strengthen the landing gear by:
- resisting forward and backward loads
- stabilizing the gear during braking and landing impact

# Rotation Lockpins
Rotation lockpins ensure that:
- the landing gear remains fixed in the correct position
- unwanted rotation does not occur during ground operations

# Oleo Cylinder and Oleo Piston
The **oleo strut** consists of:
- an oleo cylinder
- an oleo piston

This system acts as a **shock absorber** by:
- compressing during landing
- converting kinetic energy into heat

It reduces stress on the aircraft structure and improves passenger comfort.

# Axle Beam Assembly
The axle beam assembly supports:
- the wheels
- the braking system

It distributes the aircraft’s weight evenly across the wheels.

# Axle Beam Fold and Compensating Actuator
This actuator allows the axle beam to:
- fold during retraction
- fit into limited space inside the wheel bay

# Brake Assembly
The brake assembly is mounted on the wheels and is used to:
- slow the aircraft after landing
- stop the aircraft on the runway
- control speed while taxiing

Aircraft brakes are extremely powerful due to high landing speeds and aircraft weight.

# Tyres and Wheels
Aircraft tyres are designed to:
- withstand very high loads
- tolerate high temperatures during braking
- operate safely at high speeds
- 
# Sensing Wheel
The sensing wheel provides information such as:
- wheel speed
- ground contact status

This data is used by aircraft systems like:
- anti-skid braking
- landing gear logic systems

> Landing gear systems are designed to handle extreme loads for very short durations,  
> making them some of the strongest structures on an aircraft despite their limited use time.
