                                            Chapter 2: Major components of aircraft
An aircraft is divided into 5 major components:
1)Fuselage
2)Wings
3)Empennage
4)Powerplant
5)Landing gear

1)Fuselage(the body of the aircraft):

-what is fuselage?
  Fuselage is the main body of the aircraft that connects everything:
-Wings
-tail
-engines
-landing gear 

*what does the fuselage contain?
-inside fuselage:
cockpit (pilot sits here)
passenger cabin
cargo compartment
control cables/wires
avionics(electronics)
-so fuselage is not empty,it is packed with system

You may wonder why the round or cylindrical shape for fuselage?
At higher altitude outside air pressure is very low and inside cabin pressure is higher(for humans)
A circular shape distributes pressure evenly,avoids stress concentration,reduces risk of cracks,thats why aircraft dont have square bodies.


2)Wings: 



why wings exist?
  -wings generate lift through the air flow while the engines throws air and generate speed,the lift generated by the wings make the aircraft fly.

How wings are built?
A wing is not hollow,inside it has:
spars: Main strength beams(carry bending load)
Ribs: Gives shape to wings
skin: Smooth outer surface
Together they form a strong and lightweight box.

-Wings shape(airfoil):
Wings are curved on top and flatter at bottom
This shape helps create pressure difference,which produces lift.

-Winglets:
  reduce drag
  improve fuel efficiency
  control wingtip vortices
small part is also big fuel saving


3)Empennage(Tail section-stability)
The empennage is the tail of the aircraft its main job is stability and control.

-Horizontal stabillizer
controls pitch(nose up and down)
works well with elevator
IF YOU PULL THE STICK THE NOSE GOES UP
IF YOU PUSH THE STICK THE NOSE GOES DOWN

Vertical stabilizer:
controls yaw(left and right)
works with rudder
without it aircraft would swing left-right uncontrollably

why tail is needed?
Wings alone can lift the aircraft,but tail keeps it flying straight and stable.


4)Powerplant(Engines):
-What engines do?
Engines provide thrust

Thrust provides aircraft forward and air flows over wings and lift happens

Types of Engines:
-Propeller engines: training and small aircraft
-Jet engines: commercial aircrafts

How engines work?
The engine when set to full thrust sucks air from the front and compresses it inside and burns fuel and throws air from behind with so much power that the aircraft starts 
to move forward which makes air flow through wings so that lift can be generated.

It also has a scientific explanation from Newton's law
For every action there is equal and opposite reaction 

Air backward-Aircraft forward

you may wonder why engines are under wings:
engines are under wings because of better structural support,easy maintainence,less stress on fuselage,safer in engine failure


6)Landing gear:
wheels which support the aircraft on ground,allows taxing and also absorbs all landing shock while landing.
